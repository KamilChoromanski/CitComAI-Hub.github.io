### Service 2: Build-Your-Own Utility Dataset  
This modular service enables data consumers (e.g. researchers, startups) to configure and request customized datasets based on available utility data.  
Users select a base dataset (electricity, water, heating) and can combine it with open data sources such as weather data, building information (BBR), electricity spot prices, or demographic data. The final dataset is delivered at the desired processing level (e.g. anonymised or pseudonymised), and pricing depends on the complexity and scope of the request.

### Service 3: Open Utility Datasets  
This service provides free access to pre-approved, anonymised datasets via Center Denmarkâ€™s data portal.  
It is designed for early-stage experimentation, prototyping, education, and exploratory analysis. The datasets are ready to use and can be combined with publicly available data sources such as weather and building data, without any need for customization.
