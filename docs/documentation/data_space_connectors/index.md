title: Connectors

A data space connector is a technical component that enables the secure and controlled exchange of data between organisations within a data space. It functions as a gateway that manages communication, authentication, and data usage policies. Each participant deploys their own connector, ensuring sovereignty over their data. Furthermore, it promotes interoperability by adhering to standards such as those set by IDSA or Gaia-X.

Currently, only two data space connector technologies can be considered prominent: **Eclipse** and **Fiware**. On the other hand, **Simpl**, which is based on Eclipse technologies, is still in its early stages of development. As it progresses, Simpl aims to leverage the foundational strengths of Eclipse to provide a final product solution within the data space connector landscape in the EU.

Below, we provide an analysis of each alternative and an introductory guide to testing the software.
