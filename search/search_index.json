Start by changing your <code>.env</code> variables so they point to your real data platform. However, some changes, such as implementing an authentication method, may be required. The Minimal Interoperable AI Service is a starting point; therefore, feel free to explore and edit the project to start building it up on your own. Here are some tips that can help you adapt this example to your needs:</p> Project structure <ul> <li><code>static/</code>: Frontend folder. <ul> <li><code>index.html</code>: Defines the UI</li> <li><code>main.js</code>: Defines the main logic.</li> <li><code>modules/</code>: Includes entity classes, API rest client, optimization logic, leaflet stuff, and UI functions.</li> <li><code>style.css</code>: Main CSS style sheet.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>server.py</code>:  Sets up the Flask server and exposes the service API.</li> <li><code>services/Optimization.py</code>: Defines the query for Openroute optimization service. </li> <li><code>lib/</code>: External python libraries.</li> </ul> Formulate new delivery/pickup problems <p>We worked with optimizing trucks routes (<code>Vehicle</code> entity) to pickup <code>WasteContainers</code> that are full (<code>fillingLevel</code> attribute). However, these entities can be replaced to formulate new delivery/pickup problems. Visit the Smart Data Models repositories for more entities and decide which attributes are relevant for your problem. To integrate these changes in the project, you should create the corresponding entity classes in <code>static/modules/</code> folder, just like <code>WasteContainer.js</code>. Take also a look at <code>main.js</code> and modify it accordingly. </p> <p>Moreover, maybe your situation needs to consider some time restrictions or priorities. Check out the Openroute service API specification, which is powerful and includes many parameters to fit your optimization needs. To change/add additional query parameters, go over <code>Optimization.py</code> and <code>Optimizer.js</code> files.</p> Level 1: Authentication <p>When working with brokers in a production state, authentication is often required. The <code>ngsild-client</code> library included in the example does not come with authentication support. However, it is quite straightforward to extend it to meet authentication requirements. As an example, see the following code from the Valencia TEF site implementation, which implementes authentication for their NGSIv2 setup.</p> <pre><code>from lib.ngsildclient.Auth import Authv2\nfrom lib.ngsildclient.Client import Client\n\n\n# Define service &amp; subservice\nservice = \"tef_city\"\nsubservice = \"/containers\"\n\n# Authenticate\nauth = Authv2()\ntoken = auth.get_auth_token_subservice(service, subservice)\n\n# Ngsi-ld broker client\nclient = Client()\n\n# Fetch WasteContainer entities\ncontext = os.environ.get(\"WASTECONTAINERS_CONTEXT\")\ncontainers = client.get_all_entities_by_type(\"WasteContainer\", context, 100, 0, service, subservice, token).json()\n</code></pre> <p>Environment variables in <code>.env</code> file:</p> <pre><code>AUTH_PROTOCOL=\"https\"\nENDPOINT_KEYSTONE=\"auth.tef.com:15000\"\nAUTH_USER=\"xxxxx\"\nAUTH_PASSWORD=\"xxxxx\"\n</code></pre> Level 2: Data Space Connector Authentication <p>If your TEF has a data space connector deployed, you can use the <code>fdsauth</code> python library to authenticate and retrieve the corresponding token. To install <code>fdsauth</code>, simply use <code>pip</code>:   <pre><code>pip install fdsauth\n</code></pre>   Next, a DID (Decentralized Identifier) and the corresponding key-material is required. You can create such via:   <pre><code>mkdir certs &amp;&amp; cd certs\ndocker run -v $(pwd):/cert quay.io/wi_stefan/did-helper:0.1.1\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then, use the following example code to obtain your authentication token:   <pre><code>from fdsauth import Consumer\nimport requests\n\nconsumer = Consumer(\n    keycloak_protocol=\"http\",\n    keycloak_endpoint=\"keycloak.consumer-a.local\",\n    keycloak_realm_path=\"realms/test-realm/protocol\",\n    keycloak_user_name=\"test-user\",\n    keycloak_user_password=\"test\",\n    apisix_protocol=\"http\",\n    apisix_endpoint=\"apisix-proxy.provider-a.local\",\n    certs_path=\"./certs\",\n)\n\ntoken = consumer.get_data_service_access_token()\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to access data using the obtained service token. Get entities of type EnergyReport.\n    url = f\"http://apisix-proxy.provider-a.local/ngsi-ld/v1/entities?type=EnergyReport\"\n    headers = {\n        \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\",\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    print(response.json())\nexcept Exception as req_err:\n    print(f\"Request error occurred: {req_err}\")\n</code></pre>   For more details, check out the fdsauth repository.</p>"},{"location":"services/waste_collection/#track-and-status-of-known-problems","title":"Track and status of known problems","text":"<ul> <li> Openroute optimization service has a maximum limit of 70 locations.

It includes two key locations: the UpTown District from Euromilano and the Olympic Village from Covivio. Both areas sit at the heart of major urban regeneration projects, where public and private stakeholders work together to deliver new buildings that blend housing, commercial, and recreational facilities to improve quality of life and promote environmental sustainability. The UpTown District rises in the Cascina Merlata area of Milano, the former Expo 20215 venue. It is a modern neighborhood that hosts over 15,000 residents, with housing and services integrated into the urban fabric. One of Milano's largest parks surrounds the area, offering 300,000 square meters of green space rich in biodiversity. The Olympic Village is taking shape in Porta Romana, a central district of Milano. It will host athletes during the 2026 Winter Olympic Games before being repurposed for student housing and public use. These two sites offer a unique opportunity: test advanced AI in the city's heart. From automated monitoring and predictive maintenance to energy optimization, urban planning, and biodiversity tracking, the UpTown District and Olympic Village serve as real-world labs for intelligent facility management at the metropolitan scale.</p> <p>Politecnico di Milano, Italy's top-ranking technical university, leads the site through the joint work of two departments: DEIB, focused on electronics and information technology, and ABC, focused on architecture, built environment, and construction engineering. Two key partners ensure a direct connection with the urban landscape. Euromilano, a real estate developer specializing in urban regeneration, manages the UpTown testing areas, providing practical integration of AI solutions in real estate and infrastructure projects. Covivio contributes expertise in sustainable urban development and innovative facility management.</p> <p>The Milano TEF site is part of the CitCom.ai project. It features state-of-the-art infrastructure, facilitating collaboration between cities and communities, industrial partners, and research institutions and bringing AI innovation into everyday urban operations. By combining AI-driven sensor networks, facility automation, and edge/cloud computing solutions, the Milano TEF enables real-world validation of AI technologies, unlocking long-term regeneration projects, boosting sustainability, improving quality of life, and strengthening collaboration between academia, industry, and public stakeholders.</p>"},{"location":"tef/south_connect/milano/#services-offered","title":"Services Offered","text":""},{"location":"tef/south_connect/milano/#it-services","title":"IT Services","text":"<ul> <li>Embedded AI/IoT Sofware Design and Development: design and development of embedded AI/IoT software for sensing, computing, and communication; including hardware-specific customization.
