# Data Space Deployment

As we have seen in the [Data Space - Join one](./join.md) section, it is mandatory to deploy a connector in each organization that wants to share data in a Data Space. This connector is responsible for managing the data sharing process with the rest of the Data Space members.

These are the instructions to deploy a Data Space from scratch with Fiware technologies.

## Minimal Viable Data Space

A Minimum Viable Data Space (MVDS) is a basic configuration of a data space that includes only the essential components required (*Trust Framework* and *Connector*) to ensure interoperability and enable the secure and sovereign exchange of information between organisations. Its minimal approach aims to reduce initial complexity, support technological adoption, and provide a way to test the ecosystemâ€™s functionality before scaling to more comprehensive solutions.

This type of data space serves as a testing environment that facilitates the validation of data exchange models and a gradual migration from existing systems. Thanks to its streamlined structure, the MVDS is especially well-suited for demonstrations, pilots, or early implementation stages in collaborative settings where data sharing is expected to be trustworthy and controlled.

Following the interoperability levels (0, 1 and 2; section [Interoperability Levels](../interoperability.md#interoperability-levels)), the MVDS aims to provide the minimal set of tools required to progress from interoperability level 1 to level 2.

### FIWARE Data Space Connector

FIWARE developed a Data Space Connector that can be deployed in a [local](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector/blob/main/doc/deployment-integration/local-deployment/LOCAL.MD) environment. This connector is a minimal version of the Data Space Connector that can be used to test the Data Space functionalities.

### From scratch

This section describes how to deploy a Data Space from scratch in different scenarios:

- Cloud provider.
- On-premises infrastructure.

    This guide is a work in progress. It will be updated with more detailed in the next months. [Terraform deployment](https://github.com/CitComAI-Hub/Minimum_Viable_DataSpace_Infrastructure/tree/main/examples/kind_minimal_ds_local).

## Data Federation

The Data Federation is a more complex scenario where multiple Data Spaces or data platform are federated to share data. Depending on the technology used, the federation process can be different.
